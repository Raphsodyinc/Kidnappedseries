      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Lordson Anson, and storytelling has always been at the heart of who I am. From an early age, I found myself fascinated by the power of words and how they could transport people into worlds beyond their own. What started as a love for reading and daydreaming soon evolved into a passion for writing—crafting stories that blend imagination, emotion, and truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey as a writer has been shaped by a desire to explore human resilience, the complexities of relationships, and the choices that define us. Each project I create is more than entertainment—it’s an attempt to spark reflection, inspire courage, and connect with audiences on a deeper level.
      </p>
      <p>
        The inspiration behind KIDNAPPED came from my desire to bring into awareness the ill effect of kidnapping in the society and showcase it in an international format. I wanted to capture not just action and drama, but also the raw emotions and struggles that make the story feel real. <br>

Through this film, my goal is to give audiences an unforgettable experience—one that entertains, moves, and stays with them long after the credits roll. I'm hopeful that this will guarantee international appreciation.
